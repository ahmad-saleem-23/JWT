# Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)

This repo contains a working app that includes CRUD operations for fruit. It has the beginnings of authentication such as a `<Nav>` component with buttons for registering and signing in and a component to conditionally hide/show its child components based on if the user is authenticated.

Our task is to complete the authentication implementation of this app.
